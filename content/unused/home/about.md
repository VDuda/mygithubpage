# Biography

I thinks holistically about technology, envisioning better processes, building them, operating them, and incorporating the tools and systems that support them. A disciple of pragmatism, I engineers scalable solutions that work in the real world.

I've worked at another start-up in the Kendall/MIT neighborhood, where he focused on building out integrations and drivers for the distributed database product. Admiring the experience, he tackled every piece of the organization, working with cloud technologies, a facet of languages, and even getting gritty with switch programming.

In his personal life, Vlad tries to get outdoors as much as possible. A believer in a healthy lifestyle, he could be found exercising in the gym on weekdays - mixing cardio and resistance training. His hobbies consist of sailing and kayaking on the Charles, snowboarding during the winters, frequenting Boston meet-ups (Bitcoin and PHP!) and staying as mellow as possible.
