      <description>Well for one, the first come first serve principle doesn&amp;rsquo;t always hold true within the landscape of software. Time is maleable within the computer science world. Misunderstanding time has led to space shuttle explosions, database exploits, incorrect gps direction, and plenty of other examples!
For the past few years, I have devoted a significant amount of time to troubleshooting issues related with time. Time has a massive impact on our society based on how we: define, calculate, and understand time.</description>

      <title>Prompt Engineering Will Not Be Necessary in the Future</title>

      <description>Prompting large language models (LLMs) is more of an art than a science, and it requires significant effort to develop useful prompts. However, prompt engineering is not a sustainable approach to querying LLMs, and it won&amp;rsquo;t be necessary in the future.
Current prompt engineering methods rely on concatenation or templating, but these have limitations for handling complex prompts and require structured data inputs and outputs for best use.
Prompt engineering today primarily relies on prompt concatenation or templating.</description>
