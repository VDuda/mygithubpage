      <description>Drawing from the AI cycle of 2016-2018, there are some insights that can be developed:
  Importance of Strategic Planning: Many startups fell into the trap of assuming that AI development would be a linear process, and that increased computing power and data would naturally lead to improved AI capabilities. Infrastructure takes time to build (and time to sell to enterprises).
  Need for Sustainable Business Models: The failure of the &amp;ldquo;Human-in-the-loop&amp;rdquo; approach underscores the need for sustainable business models.</description>

      <description>As LLMs become more widespread, there are a few key groups of potential winners:
 Incumbents with existing distribution networks: Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon can layer LLMs into their existing products and services to enhance the user experience. For example, Google Search could use LLMs to provide more comprehensive and informative answers to user queries. New companies that develop specialized LLM applications: There is an opportunity for new companies to develop specialized LLM applications that are tailored to the needs of specific industries or user groups.</description>

      <title>Maker Time: The Key to High-Performing Software Teams</title>
      <link>https://vlad-duda.com/blog/maker-time/</link>

      <description>Time is the most important factor in creating high-performing software teams. Managers must carefully manage time, scope, and people to deliver successfully.
 Time: The total time the team spends on a problem. Scope: The functionality of the completed work. People: The number of people on the team and their skills.  What teams do with their time is the primary factor in determining their output. Even if you hire the best engineers, they will not succeed if they spend all their time on the wrong things or are constantly interrupted.</description>

      <title>Prompt Engineering Will Not Be Necessary in the Future</title>
      <link>https://vlad-duda.com/blog/prompt-engineering/</link>

      <description>Prompting large language models (LLMs) is more of an art than a science, and it requires significant effort to develop useful prompts. However, prompt engineering is not a sustainable approach to querying LLMs, and it won&amp;rsquo;t be necessary in the future.
Current prompt engineering methods rely on concatenation or templating, but these have limitations for handling complex prompts and require structured data inputs and outputs for best use.
Prompt engineering today primarily relies on prompt concatenation or templating.</description>

      <title>User-Friendly Approaches and Diverse Language Support</title>

      <description>The shift towards User-Friendly approaches of data Python has long been the go-to choice for many tasks involving data â€” from analyzing data to developing machine learning models. It&amp;rsquo;s been preferred largely because it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use across different computer systems, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require rigid data type definitions, and it&amp;rsquo;s great for quickly trying out ideas, which is often needed in data-related fields. Anything that can&amp;rsquo;t be done in SQL is done in Python.</description>
